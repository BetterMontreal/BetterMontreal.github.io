You and your friends can edit and create new activities on [bettermtl.com](http://bettermtl.com).

To *edit* an activity, (maybe you spoted a spelling mistake?), simply follow the "Improve this page" link at the top of most pages.

To *create* a new activity:
- Create a *new file* in the  [`_activities`](https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io/tree/master/_activities) directory 
- Copy the example post bellow to get a head start, and delete the specific details which you cannot specify at this time (maybe location, or time)
- Ensure the file name has the `.md` ending
- You must commit the new file to save the post. In a few moments you'll see it live on [bettermtl.com](http://bettermtl.com)

Name the file in the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`

## Activity content

Write your content using markdown right bellow the front-matter config.

## Don't stop here
Locations (in `_locations`) and people/organizational nodes (in `_network`) work in the same way.
