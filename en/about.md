Citydwellers self-organize: you and everyone may

- create topics
- link a place-date-time **to a topic** so that it becomes an event
- comment or correct any aspect of any event

This software is free of legal constraint, and you may modify this software because it's open source.


# Who we are

We use a "subject matter" as a pivot point. Some of us are organizers who host events; some of us attend events. Together we can make the city better. If you participate in any subject-matter activity, BetterMtl will help you promote and collaborate with others.

# How to

[Publish an event](/create). At least propose a topic. Comment on [bugs and development issues](waffle.io/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io) to help prioritize. [Discuss methods here](gitter.im/bettermtl/general) about rsvp'ing, attending, volunteering, contributing, fact-checking.


# Problem to solve

Many activities are calendar conflicts. Information comes in at various times from various sources. It's haphazard and a hassle to choose whether to undo an RSVP sent in, or leave this till the last minute or not at all.

Together we can build an open collaborative attention management platform, to post a topic or an event, let anyone correct details, and also turn it into a newsletter item at same time.

As an attendee we want to choose and honour our RSVP's. When we are an event organizer we want valid data, to know those who RSVP are indeed valid (e.g. will arrive on time and stay for the event). 


# The co-opetition
We can rally and merge groups of organizers-admins-curators to create a more collaborative event space. 
E.g.
**Independently curated calendars (Spring 2016)**

1. [Montreal NewTech & Startup Events calendar](http://notman.org/event-space/#mtltech) curated by [Ilias Benjelloun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliasbenjelloun)
1. [Your Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=true&radius=50&userFreeform=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+QC&mcId=z278063&mcName=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+Qu%C3%A9bec%2C+CA&eventFilter=mysugg), see *Export to...* link on the right sidebar
1. Search the local [Eventbrite events](https://www.eventbrite.ca/d/canada--montreal/events/?crt=regular&sort=best&view=list), as you register to these, they show up automatically in your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) for example
1. [Your own upcoming Facebook events](https://www.facebook.com/events/upcoming) feed, you can right-click *Upcoming Events* link, see lower-right sidebar, and add your calendar by URL into [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
1. [MTLData Calendar](http://mtldata.com/calendar/) duplicates a lot of technical meetups posted by other groups
1. UPGlobal's (this is the Startup Weekend crowd) [Montreal Startup Digest calendar](https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/montreal) - you need to register to receive the weekly newsletter
1. [Montreal in Technology calendar](http://www.montrealintechnology.com/calendar/)
1. *Add your own favorite events lists here*
1. *Any of these sources might propagate errors instead of propagating the right copy of your event*


If you have all these calendars feeding your personal .ics calendar, great! 
If you read them all - comparing and contrasting - and 
if you're happy doing that work, then you don't need this project.
But, if you find it to be a mess, then contribute to this project.
