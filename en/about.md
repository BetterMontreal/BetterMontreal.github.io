Citydwellers self organize, bottom-up or top-down.

Everyone may
- item create topics
- item link a place-date-time **to a topic** so that it becomes an event
- item comment-correct any aspect of a topic or event

This software is free of legal constraint. You may modify this software; it's open source.



# Who we are

We are people interested in using any "subject matter" as a pivot point. Some of us are organizers who host events. Together we can make the city better. If you are attend, or are active as a participant in any subject-matter activity, this project will help you promote and collaborate with others (other participants and other groups.)

# How to get involved

See your way through to [publish an event](/create). At least propose a topic. Comment on [bugs and development issues](waffle.io/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io) to help report and prioritize. Add to the [discussion here](gitter.im/bettermtl/general) especially for better methods of showing information about attention management (rsvp'ing, attending, volunteering, contributing, fact-checking). Star ★ the [bettermtl.github.io](https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io) repo. Show you care - about the success of this project. It motivates us. Thank you because we appreciate your vote of confidence!


# Problem to solve

Many activities are calendar conflicts. We get information about them at various times, from many sources. It's haphazard — much time wasted. It's a hassle to check for corrections or comments here and there. It can be hard to choose whether to undo an RSVP sent in, so you may leave this till the last minute or not at all.

Together we can build an open collaborative attention management platform, to post a topic or an event, let anyone correct details and also turn it into a newsletter item at same time.  

If people correct details, it's for all to see: a common source file. As an attendee we want to easily choose and honour our RSVP's. When we are an event organizer we want valid data, to know whose RSVP is still valid (e.g. arrive on time and stay for the event). 

Anyone can include your event in their newsletter — with a single click.


# The co-opetition
We can rally and merge groups of organizers-admins-curators to create a more collaborative event space. 
E.g.
**Independently curated calendars (Spring 2016)**

1. [Montreal NewTech & Startup Events calendar](http://notman.org/event-space/#mtltech) curated by [Ilias Benjelloun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliasbenjelloun)
1. [Your Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=true&radius=50&userFreeform=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+QC&mcId=z278063&mcName=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+Qu%C3%A9bec%2C+CA&eventFilter=mysugg), see *Export to...* link on the right sidebar
1. Search the local [Eventbrite events](https://www.eventbrite.ca/d/canada--montreal/events/?crt=regular&sort=best&view=list), as you register to these, they show up automatically in your [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) for example
1. [Your own upcoming Facebook events](https://www.facebook.com/events/upcoming) feed, you can right-click *Upcoming Events* link, see lower-right sidebar, and add your calendar by URL into [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/)
1. [MTLData Calendar](http://mtldata.com/calendar/) duplicates a lot of technical meetups posted by other groups
1. UPGlobal's (this is the Startup Weekend crowd) [Montreal Startup Digest calendar](https://www.startupdigest.com/digests/montreal) - you need to register to receive the weekly newsletter
1. [Montreal in Technology calendar](http://www.montrealintechnology.com/calendar/)
1. *Add your own favorite events lists here*
1. *Any of these sources might propagate errors instead of propagating the right copy of your event*


If you have all these calendars feeding your personal .ics calendar, great! 
If you read them all - comparing and contrasting - and 
if you're happy doing that work, then you don't need this project.
But, if you find it to be a mess, then contribute to this project.
