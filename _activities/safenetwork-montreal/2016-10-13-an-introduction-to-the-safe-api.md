Let's learn **how to build apps for the SAFE Network**!

The [SAFE Network](https://safenetwork.org/) is a decentralized data storage and communications network that provides a secure, efficient and no-cost infrastructure for app developers.

Here are some examples of open source apps that have been built using the REST API exposed by [SAFE Launcher](https://maidsafe.readme.io/docs/launcher):

* [SAFE Demo App](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-demo-app/)
* [SAFE Beaker Browser](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-beaker-browser/)
* [SAFE Mail Tutorial](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safe-mail-tutorial/)
* [SafeEditor](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safeeditor/)
* [SafeNote](https://apps.safenetwork.org/safenote/)
