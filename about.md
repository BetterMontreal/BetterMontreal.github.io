BetterMTL is to get citydwellers to self organize bottom-up. 

You may create topics. You may associate a place and a day to your topic so that it becomes an event. 

You may add corrections, comments and requests.

It's open source, and free of legal constraint. You may modify this software.



# Who we are

We are people interested in a subject matter (any "subject matter") and some of us are organizers who host events. Together we can make the city better. If you are active as participant or volunteer organizing subject-matter activity, this project will help you promote and collaborate with others (other participants and other groups.)

# How to get involved

Star ★ the [bettermtl.github.io](https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io) repo.

Thank you because we appreciate your vote of confidence!

See your way through to [publish](/create) an event or at least to post a proposed new topic.

# The Problem we are solving

Many activities are calendar conflicts. We get information from many sources at various times. It's haphazard — much time wasted. It's a hassle to check for corrections or comments here and there. It can be hard to choose whether to undo an RSVP sent in, so we leave this till the last minute or not at all.

Together we can build an open collaborative attention management platform for you me and everyone, to post a topic or an event, let anyone correct details and also turn it into a newsletter item at same time. Anyone can include your event in their newsletter — with a single click. 

If they correct details, it's for all to see: a common source file. As an attendee we want to easily choose and honour our RSVP's. When we are an event organizer we want valid data, to know whose RSVP is still valid (e.g. arrive on time and stay for the event).


# The co-opetition
We can rally and merge groups of organizers-admins-curators to create a more collaborative event space. 
E.g.
**Independently curated calendars (Spring 2016)**

1. [Montreal NewTech & Startup Events calendar](http://notman.org/event-space/#mtltech) curated by [Ilias Benjelloun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iliasbenjelloun)
1. [Your Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/find/events/?allMeetups=true&radius=50&userFreeform=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+QC&mcId=z278063&mcName=Montr%C3%A9al%2C+Qu%C3%A9bec%2C+CA&eventFilter=mysugg), see *Export to...* link on the right sidebar

If you have all these calendars feeding your personal .ics calendar, great! 
If you read them all - comparing and contrasting - and 
if you're happy doing that work, then you don't need this project.
But, if you find it to be a mess, then contribute to this project.
