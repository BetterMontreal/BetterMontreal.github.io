[BetterMTL](http://bettermtl.github.io) allows Montreal to self-organize itself and speak with one voice.

It is a free open source project which allows you to create events, showing times and information for anybody that wants to attend.

# The Problem we are solving

Many activities conflict with one another and there are many sources of information — calendars in Facebook, in specialized websites like Eventbrite or Meetup, or independent mailing lists. It's haphazard — much time wasted checking for corrections or comments here and there. 

There is not yet any open/collaborative digest or newsletter. 
Currently, there's no way for people to
post an event or post corrections
publish an event and your newsletter at same time
publish an event and let anyone else include it in their newsletter — with a single click
publish an event and let anyone make corrections
