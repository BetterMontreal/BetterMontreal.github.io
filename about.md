BetterMTL is for a city to self-organize bottom-up and speak with one voice.

The software is open source and free of legal constraint. You may modify this software. You may create topics. Your topic may have a day associated to it: then it becomes an event. 


# Who we are

We are a group of community organizers of large and small mostly tech events in Montreal.

If you are organizing a tech meetup or are an active participant or volunteer in the startup community, the BetterMTL project will affect how you go about promoting and collaboration with other active groups in Montreal.

# How to get involved

Begin by ★ staring the [bettermtl.github.io](https://github.com/bettermtl/bettermtl.github.io) repo - we really appreciate your vote of confidence! It keeps us motivated to know you care about the success of this project.

Secondly, see how you can [publish](/create) an event.

# The Problem we are solving

Many activities conflict with one another and there are many sources of information — calendars in Facebook, in specialized websites like Eventbrite or Meetup, or independent mailing lists. It's haphazard — much time wasted checking for corrections or comments here and there.

Together we're creating a collaborative city-wide attention management platform for you and me, the people, to post an event, submit corrections, even publish a newsletter at same time, or let anyone else include your event in their newsletter — with a single click.

# The co-opetition
We hope to rally and merge a few groups of organizers-admins-curators to create a more collaborative event space for Montreal, for a better Montreal.
