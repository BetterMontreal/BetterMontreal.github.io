[BetterMTL](http://bettermtl.github.io) allows Montreal to self-organize and speak with one voice.

It is a free open source project which allows you to create events, showing times and information for anybody that wants to attend.

# The Problem we are solving

Many activities conflict with one another and there are many sources of information — calendars in Facebook, in specialized websites like Eventbrite or Meetup, or independent mailing lists. It's haphazard — much time wasted checking for corrections or comments here and there. 

Currently, there's no way for people to post an event, post corrections, publish a newsletter at same time, or let anyone else include your event in their newsletter — with a single click

There is not yet any open/collaborative digest or newsletter.
