# Evento

Evento is a minimal, responsive theme for Jekyll. The projects allows people, groups or companies to host and show a list future and past events.

Why I created it:

At my current place of work we run internal speaker events called Brownbags.
 
Brownbags are a great platform and environment for professionals to speak about anything that interests them. 

The main problem I found was that there was no **easy to use** platform to see what Brownbags, Internal Training or other events are coming up or have already gone, so I created [Evento](https://github.com/boyney123/evento)

This free and opensource platform should allow any organisation or group to collect and share their events in one place.
